libarpg sources
Libargp is part of gnulib: http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib.
In order to extract argp from gnulib you need to run gnulib-tool tool which is
distributed together with gnulib sources. In order to extract libargp to
<destination-directory> run gnulib-tool like this:
  cd <gnulib dir>
  ./gnulib-tool --create-testdir --lib="libargp" --dir=<destination-dir> argp

Building:
gnulib-tool produces autotools like package with the regular configure script.
However, there are a few problems:
- `make install` target seems not to do its job, we need to copy libargp.a and
  libargp.h manually.
- libargp.h depends on few macros that are defined in the generated config.h.
  To work around that we have a wrapper header that defines minimalistic
  versions of these macros and includes the actual header
- configure script modifies Makefile.in (in some environments). To avoid having
  to deal with that we copy all the sources to the build directory before
  invoking configure
