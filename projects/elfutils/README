Building:
Elfutils is packaged with autotools, you need to run included configure script
and then delegate to make. Issues we need to work around:
- elfutils depends on argp and obstack (or gnulibc) and configure scripts
  enforces this dependency. We build libargp.a/libobstack.a exactly for this
  reason
- elfutils depend on a number of gnu extensions. libelf requires only a few
  though and we're able to provide necessary "compatibility layer" for it
  without building gnulib or glibc:
  - few functions from `libint.h` header
    android_fixups/libint.h provides no-op versions of those functions
  - `program_invocation_short_name` variable
    we define macro named `program_invocation_short_name` which resolves to
    "no-program_invocation_short_name"
  We don't bother with remaining dependencies, so utils like readelf are not
  compiled.
