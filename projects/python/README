Default version: v3.6.8
https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/v3.6.8

Building:
- configure scripts needs to be told explicitely what the build environment is
  (--build=x86_64)
- to build shared library and relocatable python binary we pass
  `--enable-shared` flag and set LINKFORSHARED="-pie" environment
  variable when invoking configure script
- due to lack of libs we need to disable ipv6 (--disable-ipv6)
- python/config.site contains additional configuration configure script
  complains about and needs to be passed to configure script via
  CONFIG_SITE env variable
